[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c5bfaed1-321e-412d-a4f4-affc372a2645/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/my-first-html-project-website/deploys)

Welcome to my first HTML project! This project is inspired by the [HTML Project for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA) tutorial by Dave Gray.

## Project Description

This project is a simple HTML website that I created as a part of my learning journey in web development. The goal was to apply the basic concepts of HTML and build a foundation for future projects.

## What I Learned

- Basic structure of an HTML document
- Using tags like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<title>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`
- Implementing headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Adding images and setting their attributes
- Structuring content with the use of divs and spans
- Applying inline and external CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## Features

- Navigation bar to easily move between sections
- Image gallery showcasing my favorite photos
- Contact form for visitors to send messages

## Reflection

This project was an exciting first step into the world of web development. I faced challenges along the way, but overcoming them was incredibly rewarding. I look forward to building more complex projects and enhancing my skills.
